## Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "conda command not found" | Add Conda to your PATH or restart your terminal |
| Environment not activating | Check if Conda is initialized (`conda init`) |
| Package conflicts | Try installing in a clean environment or use `--force` with caution |
| Slow installations | Use the faster Mamba drop-in replacement: `conda install -c conda-forge mamba` |
| Environment corruption | Create a new environment and reinstall packages from `environment.yml` |

## Tips for Workshop

- Create a dedicated environment specifically for the chatbot project
- Use `environment.yml` to share the exact environment with all participants
- Pin critical package versions to ensure compatibility
- Consider using `conda-forge` channel for more up-to-date packages
