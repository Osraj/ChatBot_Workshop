## How to Use

1. Choose the reference card(s) you need
2. Print the page or keep it open in a separate window
3. Refer to it when you need a quick reminder of a command or syntax

These cards are intentionally minimal and focus only on the most commonly used commands to avoid overwhelming you with information.

## Printing Tips

- Print in landscape orientation for best results
- Consider printing double-sided if you need multiple cards
- Use the "fit to page" option in your printer settings
